Number Sorting Game

# Input/Outpit
[main.cpp lines 89,111,113,116,121,126,135,137,140 ](/main.cpp)
[RandomArrays.cpp lines 29](/RandomArrays.cpp)
These various couts and cins demonstrate the knowledge of C++ syntax, as well as storing user inputs as variables, and outputting variables to the screen.

# Control Flow Constructs
[main.cpp lines 69-74, 114-122, 127-146, 138-145](/main.cpp)
These if statements evaluate the truth of statements for instance the line 69-74 if statement evaluates wether or not the first value is larger or smaller than the second value within the number array. If the first value is less than the second, it will reverse their order.
# Iteration
[main.cpp lines 85-147, 91-96, 100-105, 109-123](/main.cpp)
[RandomArrays.cpp lines 14-18](/RandomArrays.cpp)
A good example use of Iteration is lines 109-123, these lines execute code that conditionally iterates depending on wether or not the users input satisfies the condition of the if statement. If the users input does not satisfy the condition, the program does not iterate, however if it does the program iterates through a total of 10 times before moving on past the while loop.


# Arrays/Vectors/Matrices
[main.cpp lines 106, 102-103, 60](/main.cpp)
[RandomArrays.cpp lines 17](/RandomArrays.cpp)
The vector used on lines 102-103 demonstrates knowledge of the topic as it utilizes the .push_back function of the vector library in order to expand the vector as needed. The vector used on line 106 is used to store the sorted values generated in the sorting function.


# Functions
[main.cpp lines 45-78, 87, 106, 129](/main.cpp)
[RandomArrays.cpp lines 11-19,21-25,26-30](/RandomArrays.cpp)
The function from lines 45-78 demonstrates understanding of functions as they relate to their return types, and passing values into them. This function is used to sort the values of a vector and return them back as a new vector.


# File IO
[main.cpp lines 48-49, 55-56](/main.cpp)
In this instance, File IO is properly used in order to save down the current record time. This means the user will have a record to come back and try to beat again and again between sessions.


# Classes
[main.cpp lines 90,93,102,](/main.cpp)
[RandomArrays.cpp lines 1-25](/RandomArrays.cpp)
This demonstrates the knowledge of creating class definitions within the classes cpp file. These class functions are used to generate a random array for the game, and to output the values of the array(Private variable).
